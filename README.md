# Nicolaj's To-Do List Project

This is a simple, versioned To-Do List app built in Python, evolving from a basic text-based interface to a modern GUI using `customtkinter`.

Project Overview

This project shows the evolution of a Python-based productivity tool, starting with CLI versions and ending in a dark-themed, scrollable GUI. The purpose is to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently.

### Versions:

- **v0.1**: Basic terminal-based task manager (view, add, remove).
- **v0.2**: Added saving and loading from a `.txt` file.
- **v0.3**: Support for marking tasks as done or not done.
- **v0.4**: Introduced a Tkinter GUI. Tasks can be added with Enter key and toggled by double-clicking.
- **v0.5**: Upgraded to `customtkinter` for dark mode, checkboxes, scrollable UI, and real-time saving.
